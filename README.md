# Context

`context` provides context for [SDS services](https://github.com/sds-framework/service-lib).

The context owns app configuration and exposes a runtime
client for starting, stopping, adding, updating, and removing dependency services during development or later after its compiled.

## Current Model

Dependency services are configured with `config-lib` and started from each
service's `StartCommand`.

Use the current module version from Git:

```sh
go get github.com/sds-framework/context@latest
```

This version requires `github.com/sds-framework/config-lib` with `config.Socket`,
`config.Service`, `config.Handler`, and `SdsService.Save()` support.

## Context API

Create a context from a config file and the socket that the internal runtime
handler should bind to. Then start the in-process runtime handler and use
`Runtime()` to control dependency services.

```go
package main

import (
	sdscontext "github.com/sds-framework/context"
	config "github.com/sds-framework/config-lib"
)

func main() {
	runtimeSocket := config.Socket{
		Id:   "dep_handler",
		Port: 0,
	}

	ctx, err := sdscontext.New("service.json", runtimeSocket)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	if err := ctx.StartRuntimeHandler(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	runtimeClient := ctx.Runtime()
	_ = runtimeClient
}
```

The public context interface is intentionally small:

```go
type Interface interface {
	StartRuntimeHandler() error
	Runtime() runtime.ClientInterface
}
```

There is no public `CloseRuntimeHandler` or `IsHandlerRunning` API. The handler
is an internal in-process runtime detail; users normally control services via
`StartService` and `StopService`.

When `New` loads the config, it ensures there is exactly one independent service.
If none exists, it creates a default independent service for the internal runtime.
If one exists, it ensures that service has the internal runtime handler category
and socket. More than one independent service is an error.

## Runtime Client

`ctx.Runtime()` returns a `runtime.ClientInterface`.

```go
type ClientInterface interface {
	Close() error
	Timeout(duration time.Duration)
	Attempt(attempt uint8)

	AddService(service config.Service) error
	SetService(service config.Service) error
	RemoveService(serviceName string) error
	StartService(serviceName string, parent *clientConfig.Client) (string, error)
	StopService(serviceName string) error
	IsServiceRunning(serviceName string) (bool, error)
}
```

Example:

```go
id, err := ctx.Runtime().StartService("database", parentClient)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

running, err := ctx.Runtime().IsServiceRunning("database")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

if running {
	if err := ctx.Runtime().StopService("database"); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}

_ = id
```

`StartService` returns the generated runtime id for the started service, for
example `database1`.

## Runtime Package

The runtime package now contains the service runtime, runtime handler, and
runtime client.

Constructors:

```go
rt := runtime.New(cfg)
handler, err := runtime.NewHandler(cfg, runtimeSocket)
client, err := runtime.NewClient(runtimeSocket)
```

The old `dep_client` and `dep_handler` packages were folded into `runtime`.
Their generic `New()` constructors were renamed to avoid collisions:

- `dep_handler.New(...)` became `runtime.NewHandler(...)`
- `dep_client.New()` became `runtime.NewClient()`

## Service Management

Services are added, updated, and removed through config-backed runtime commands:

```go
service := config.Service{
	Type:         config.ExtensionType,
	Name:         "worker",
	StartCommand: "./worker",
	Handlers: []config.Handler{
		{
			Type:     config.ReplierType,
			Category: "manager",
			Socket: config.Socket{
				Id:   "worker-manager",
				Port: 6001,
			},
		},
	},
}

if err := ctx.Runtime().AddService(service); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

service.StartCommand = "./worker --debug"
if err := ctx.Runtime().SetService(service); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

if err := ctx.Runtime().RemoveService("worker"); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

`AddService` refuses to add independent services and refuses to overwrite an
existing service. `SetService` updates an existing service. `RemoveService`
refuses to remove a service that is currently running.

## Service Requirements

Every service managed by `context` must have at least one handler that manages
the service itself. By convention this handler uses category `manager`.

The runtime uses the `manager` handler to:

- connect to the service
- send `heartbeat` requests for `IsServiceRunning`
- send the close command for `StopService`

Example service config:

```json
{
  "type": "Extension",
  "name": "worker",
  "start-command": "./worker",
  "handlers": [
    {
      "type": "Replier",
      "category": "manager",
      "socket": {
        "id": "worker-manager",
        "port": 6001
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

User-facing API handlers can be added beside the `manager` handler. The manager
handler is reserved for runtime lifecycle operations.

Independent services are special: there can be only one independent service in
the config, and it represents the service currently using the runtime. It cannot
be added through `AddService` or stopped through `StopService`.

## Handler Details

`StartRuntimeHandler` starts an in-process handler that exposes runtime commands
over SDS handler sockets:

- `add-service`
- `set-service`
- `remove-service`
- `start-service`
- `stop-service`
- `is-service-running`

Applications usually do not interact with this handler directly. They use
`ctx.Runtime()` instead.

## Tests

Run the root package tests:

```sh
go test .
```

Runtime tests compile, but tests that start sample binaries require local test
fixtures for those binaries. The old `_test_services` submodules have been
removed.
